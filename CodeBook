This CodeBook describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data for this
assigment

Before any manipulations are done or data is downloaded, the script installs the packages needed - in this case
the "dplyr" package

Step 1 - Download rawdata and unzip it

Step 2 - Clean the train data

  Step 2A: upload the train files:
    'X_train': Training set - dim(7352, 561)
    'subject_train': Subject who performed the activity - range 1:30 - dim(7352,1)
    'y_train': Training labels - range 1:6 - dim(7352,1) 
  
  Step 2B: Assign variables to the three datasets described above
    The variable names given to the X_train file are based on the origial file "features.txt". More details provided below
    The variable name given to the variable in the subject_train file is "Subject"
    The variable name given to the variable in the y_train file is "Activity"

  Step 2C: Clean up the X_train dataset
  Step 2C consists of various steps:
      selecting only the mean and standard deviation variables. This reduces the dimension of this dataframe to dim(7352, 68)
      modifying the variable names so that they are easier to understand. 
  
  Step 2D: Merge "Clean" Train Data which was created in steps 2A through 2C
    This tep cbinds the clean files subject_Train, y_train, and X_train.
    
Step 3 - Clean the Test Data
  
  Step 3A: upload the train files:
    'X_test': Training set - dim(7352, 561)
    'subject_test': Subject who performed the activity - range 1:30 - dim(7352,1)
    'y_test': Training labels - range 1:6 - dim(7352,1) 
  
  Step 3B: Assign variables to the three datasets described in step 3A
    The variable names given to the X_test file are based on the origial file "features.txt". More details provided below
    The variable name given to the variable in the subject_test file is "Subject"
    The variable name given to the variable in the y_test file is "Activity"

  Step 3C: Clean up the X_test dataset
    Step 3C consists of various steps:
      selecting only the mean and standard deviation variables.
      modifying the variable names so that they are easier to understand. 
      
  Step 3D: Merge "Clean" Test Data which was created in steps 3A through 3C
    This step cbinds the clean files subject_test, y_test, and X_test.
    
Step 4 - Create Tidy Dataset
  Step 4A: merges Train Data (from Step 2) and Test Data (from Step 3)
  
  Step 4B: Transforms the "Activity" variable into a factor and adds labels. The lablesl are based on the original "activity_labels.txt" file

  Step 4C: Creates a tidy data, comma-delimited file entitled "Tidy_Dataset.csv". This file has dim(10,299, 68) the variables included are:

        A best effort has been made to make sure that the variables names of this dataset are self explanatory. However Additional information can be found in the "features_info.txt" of the raw files. According to this file:
          "The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
          Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
          Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals)." 

          These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
          '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions."


	
      


  Step 5: Create a dataset with the means of each of the variables
    This creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    This portion of the script uses the DPLYR functions.
    The ouput file created is a comma-delimited file called "means_dataset.csv" with dim(180, 68)
    The variaable names are the same as the file created in Step 4, except that the values are the mean values for each variable for each activyt and each subject.
